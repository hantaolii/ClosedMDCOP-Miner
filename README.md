# ClosedMDCOP-Miner
This repository contains an implementation of the algorithm described in my bachelor thesis, titled "An Algorithm for Mining Closed Mixed-Drove Spatiotemporal
Co-Occurrence Patterns."

Use the included `Makefile` to quickly compile the sources with g++. I have successfully tested the code using:

 - g++ 4.9.2
 - Apple LLVM version 6.1.0 (using Xcode v6.3.2)
 - Visual C++ 2015 (using Visual Studio 2015 RC)

Happy coding! :ok_hand:
