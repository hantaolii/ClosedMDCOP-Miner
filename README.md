# ClosedMDCOP-Miner
This repository contains an implementation of the algorithm described in my bachelor thesis, titled "An Algorithm for Mining Closed Mixed-Drove Spatiotemporal Co-Occurrence Patterns".

Use the included `Makefile` to compile the sources with g++. I have tested the code on:
- g++ 4.9.2
- Apple LLVM version 6.1.0 (using Xcode v6.3.2)
- Visual C++ 2015 (using Visual Studio 2015 RC)
